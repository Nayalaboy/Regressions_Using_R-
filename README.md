## Regressions_Using_R-

In this exercise, we will predict the number of applications received using the other variables in the College
data set. <br />
(a) Split the data set into a training set and a test set.<br />
(b) Fit a linear model using least squares on the training set, and report the test error obtained.<br />
(c) Fit a ridge regression model on the training set, with λ chosen by cross-validation. Report the test error obtained.<br />
(d) Fit a lasso model on the training set, with λ chosen by cross validation. Report the test error obtained, along with the number of non-zero coefficient
estimates. <br />
(e) Fit a PCR model on the training set, with M chosen by cross validation. Report the test error obtained, along with the value of M selected by cross-validation.<br />
(f) Fit a PLS model on the training set, with M chosen by cross validation. Report the test error obtained, along with the value of M selected by cross-validation.<br />
(g) Comment on the results obtained. How accurately can we pre dict the number of college applications received? <br /> Is there much difference among the test errors resulting from these five approaches?
